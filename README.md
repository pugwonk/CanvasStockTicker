## Canvas Power Source

This is a sample project to build a [Canvas for Pebble](http://pebblecanvas.blogspot.com/) plugin. The documentation on how to build these plugins lives [here](http://pebblecanvas.blogspot.com/p/plugins.html) - there is a sample plugin included on that page ([CanvasNowPlaying](https://github.com/sjp4/CanvasNowPlaying)), but this is a much simpler variant. All it does is display a message on your watch's screen to say whether it's plugged into external power or not.

If I was going to tell you what to do, I'd tell you to download both of these and maybe look at this one first. This one contains only the raw basics - the other one actually demos use of all the features in Canvas plugins.
