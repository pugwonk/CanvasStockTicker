## Canvas Stock Ticker

A simple stock price ticker in a [Canvas for Pebble](http://pebblecanvas.blogspot.com/) plugin. The documentation on how to build these plugins lives [here](http://pebblecanvas.blogspot.com/p/plugins.html).

Things to do:

* Stop the thing from retrieving data for charts you're not displaying
* Return something other than the program icon when stock chart data hasn't been retrieved yet
* Make it update stocks earlier than the ticker time when you add a new one or change a symbol
